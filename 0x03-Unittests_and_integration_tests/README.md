# Writing Unit Tests and Integration Tests in Python

# GitHubOrgClient Testing Overview
This test suite validates the functionality of the GithubOrgClient class, 
which interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve organization and repository 
details. Unit tests check individual methods like org, public_repos, 
and has_license using mock objects and patching. Integration tests 
simulate real API behavior using parameterized data from fixtures 
and patched requests.get responses. These tests ensure correctness 
without relying on external requests and follow unittest 
and pycodestyle best practices.
